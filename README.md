## Description
"To-Do Next" is made to look like a notebook in which you would record and organize your to-do list. Instead of just holding your activities, this page is a tool to help you prioritize what tasks you want to attack first.

The page introduces itself, then asks for your work tasks, chores and pending self care, how long you estimate each will take, and your stress level. When you submit these components, the site uses a weighted random generation algorithm to give you a suggestion for how to go about your tasks. 

## Process
While working on this, I realized how useful it was for me to pseudo-code exactly what I planned to do with each portion of the site. My first step was writing out on paper some bullet points that explained my idea in parts. Then, I would add a comment to my code as a reference for the end goal of my conditional statement before coding it. I found this particularly helpful because this was one of my first times diving into vanilla JavaScript as a web development tool (and generally outside of p5.js). It allowed me to separate working on the logic of the code from figuring out the syntax and referencing the proper components.

## Reflection
This was fun to write, code, and design. To continue iterating, I first would probably work longer on the styling of the slider. I initially thought it would be cool to have the background color of the slider change depending on the indicated stress level. I would also play with the way re-generated options are displayed, and may play with the idea of a stack of sticky notes that can be re-accessed after they are generated over.

## Credits
Thank you to Leffin Christopher who helped get me acquainted to the getElementById and getElementByClass tags. I also spent a lot of time on MDN references, W3 schools, and Stack-Overflow.
